# Brian's QA Walkthrough — BBQS v1.0.0

Welcome, Brian. This document is your hands-on QA checklist. Work through it
top-to-bottom, ticking each `[ ]` checkbox as you go. Every item has a matching
automated Playwright test in `e2e/brian-qa.spec.ts` so you can cross-check your
manual result against CI.

## How to work this document

1. **Open two windows:** the BBQS preview (or `https://brain-bbq-clone.lovable.app`)
   and this file in your editor.
2. For each section, perform the click/interaction described, then tick the box.
3. If something is broken, **do not edit the test** — file a GitHub issue using the
   template in §99 and link it from the checkbox like `[x] (bug #149)`.
4. When the whole section is green, run the matching Playwright test:
   ```bash
   npx playwright test e2e/brian-qa.spec.ts -g "§<section-number>"
   ```
5. When the entire document is green, run the whole suite:
   ```bash
   npx playwright test e2e/brian-qa.spec.ts
   ```

## Environments

| Env | URL | Auth |
|---|---|---|
| Local preview | `http://localhost:8080` | preview-mode bypass, you are signed in as `Preview User` |
| Staging | `https://staging.brain-bbqs.org` | `staging-fake-login` edge function (admin/member fixtures) |
| Prod | `https://brain-bbqs.org` | Globus OAuth — **DO NOT submit test data here** |

Run all manual + automated QA against **staging** unless told otherwise.
